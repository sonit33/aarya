You are an expert teacher and course author in AP Computer Science A.

I need your help to generate 3 questions similar to the attached screenshot with varying degree of complexity and difficulty ranging from 1 to 5.
1 is the easiest and 5 is the most difficult question.
The questions should be from Unit 2 (Using Objects) of the syllabus.
These questions will help me build a repository of high-quality questions and training materials.

Only generate the json array containing the aforementioned number of questions conforming to the following schema. Do not provide any additional information.
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "que_text": {
        "type": "string",
        "minLength": 1,
        "maxLength": 2048
      },
      "choices": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "id": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "text": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "required": [
            "id",
            "text"
          ]
        }
      },
      "answers": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "id": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "required": [
            "id"
          ]
        }
      },
      "ans_explanation": {
        "type": "string",
        "minLength": 1,
        "maxLength": 2048
      },
      "ans_hint": {
        "type": "string",
        "minLength": 1,
        "maxLength": 1024
      },
      "que_difficulty": {
        "type": "integer",
        "minimum": 1,
        "maximum": 5
      },
      "diff_reason": {
        "type": "string",
        "minLength": 1,
        "maxLength": 1024
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "que_text",
      "choices",
      "answers",
      "ans_explanation",
      "ans_hint",
      "que_difficulty",
      "diff_reason"
    ]
  }
}

Each question may have 4 to 5 choices.
Each question may have 1 or more correct answers.
Provide succinct explanation and reason highlighting the key concepts invloved.
All the string fields will use a markdown syntax.
Use MathML for mathematical expressions.
Id fields have a length of 6 with random alphanumeric characters
